1. Design objectives
- Create a clean, intuitive and modern user experience that reflects the identity of Vinyl Beats Radio.
- Prioritize ease of navigation and accessibility.
- Incorporate a minimalist design with modern touches, inspired by bento/apple aesthetics: use of white space, clear typography and simple but elegant visual elements.
- Ensure the site is responsive, adapting well to mobile and desktop devices.

2. Basic file structure
- index.html: Main page that will serve as the entry point to the site.
- styles.css: Main stylesheet that will define the general aesthetics, including fonts, colors, and layout.
- scripts.js: JavaScript file for interactive features, such as the audio player and dynamic programming.
- assets/: Folder for static resources such as images, icons and multimedia files.
- README.md: Basic project documentation.

3. Key sections of the site
- Home: Brief presentation of Vinyl Beats Radio, with an attractive design that invites listening to the radio.
- Player: Integration of a simple and accessible audio player, with basic controls (play, pause, volume).
- Schedule: Listing of programs and schedules, with a brief description of each.
- News or Blog (optional): Space for news and content related to the radio.
- Contact: Form or information for users to contact the team.
- Footer: Legal information, links to social networks and other resources.

4. Aesthetic direction
- Neutral and soft color palette, with accents in vibrant tones to highlight important elements.
- Clean and readable sans-serif typography.
- Use of white space to avoid visual saturation.
- Modular bento-style design with well-defined and ordered blocks.
- Subtle animations to enhance the experience without distracting.
- Simple and modern icons that complement the content.

This roadmap will serve as the basis for the initial development of the Vinyl Beats Radio website, ensuring a clear focus on usability and visual style consistent with the brand identity.
